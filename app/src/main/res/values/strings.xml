        About:\n
        This simple app will return all color information\n
        available in the source code of any desired website.\n
        Please note this will not return all colors\n
        found on a webpage, only the publicly available\n
        colors from the page source.\n
        This app works by pulling the source code into a\n
        bufferReader, the buffer is searched for any\n
        instances of a hexadecimal value matching that \n
        of a color value. A list of unique colors is returned.\n\n
        How to Use:\n
        Enter your desired URL. Press the search button when\n
        ready. When the list of colors is returned, simple tap\n
        on any color to copy the hexadecimal value to your\n
        clipboard. (Note: Please make sure you have a stable\n
        internet connection. If an /"Invalid URL/" message is\n
        displayed, please make sure you have entered the correct\n
        protocol, domain and resource.
