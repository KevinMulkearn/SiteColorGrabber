        This app will quickly return any colors available
        in the source code of any website. If you require a
        more specific color lookup, you can use the web page
        view option to select any color seen on the sites UI.\n\n
        How to Use:\n
        1. Enter your desired URL. Press the search button to confirm.
        When the list of colors is returned, simple tap
        on any color to save it in your app.\n
        2. If the color you are looking for is not here, select the
        Page Viewer option for the options menu. Wait for the page
        to fully load. Once the page has fully loaded, simply
        tap anywhere on the web page to choose your color.
        If you are happy with the color, tap on the color display
        box in the bottom left corner to save it.\n
        3. To view all your saved colors, select the Saved Colors,
        option from the options menu. To save the hexadecimal value
        to your clipboard, tap on the desired color. If you wish
        to delete a color from your Saved Colors menu, press and hold.\n\n
        (Note: Please make sure you have a stable
        internet connection. If an Invalid URL message is

        protocol, domain and resource.
