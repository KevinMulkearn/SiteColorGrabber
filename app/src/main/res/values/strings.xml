        About:\n
        This simple app will return all color information
        available in the source code of any desired website.
        Please note this will not return all colors
        found on a webpage, only the publicly available
        colors from the page source.\n
        This app works by pulling the source code into a
        bufferReader, the buffer is searched for any
        instances of a hexadecimal value matching that
        of a color value. A list of unique colors is then returned.\n\n
        How to Use:\n
        Enter your desired URL. Press the search button when
        ready. When the list of colors is returned, simple tap
        on any color to copy the hexadecimal value to your
        clipboard. The color will also be saved in your
        Saved Colors menu.\n
        To resave the hexadecimal value to your clipboard,
        again tap the desired color. If you wish to delete
        a color from your Saved Colors menu, press and hold.\n\n
        (Note: Please make sure you have a stable
        internet connection. If an Invalid URL message is
        displayed, please make sure you have entered the correct
        protocol, domain and resource.
